Description of the task:

The Personal Finance Tracker (PFT) project in Python is designed to manage personal finances using various programming concepts like data structures, control statements, iterations, custom functions, and libraries. It features a GUI that prompts for the user's name and displays a main window with a greeting, initial account balance, and last transaction summary. Users can add, summarize, or delete transactions, each with unique IDs. The "Add Transaction" window allows detailed input for income or expenses. All transactions are stored and displayed in the main window. The "Summary" button opens a dashboard for filtering transactions and visualizing them with bar and pie charts. Users can also delete transactions by ID, updating the balance and summary accordingly. The application is designed to be user-friendly, thoroughly commented, and ready for code reviews.
