# Personal Finance Tracker 


## Description of the task:

The Personal Finance Tracker (PFT) project in Python is designed to manage personal finances using various programming concepts like data structures, control statements, iterations, custom functions, and libraries. It features multiple GUI's that is used to collect a users user's name whether they are a new user to this PFT or not and displays a main window with a greeting, initial account balance, and last transaction summary. Users can add, summarize, or delete transactions, each with unique IDs. The "Add Transaction" window allows detailed input for income or expenses. All transactions are stored and displayed in the main window. The "Summary" button opens a dashboard for filtering transactions, visualizing them with bar and pie charts and printing out these values into a CSV file. Users can also delete transactions by ID, which would updat the balance and summary accordingly.
